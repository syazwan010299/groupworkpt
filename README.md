Yo, waddup

Use the struct to integrate everyone's work.
we have player[i].gamePiece //which player we changing values for
we have player[i].boardPos //which position on the board do we want to move the player to.

Guys to use the dice function for your own functions:

int variable = dice();

Now variable will randomly be 1 - 6
