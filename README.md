Yo, waddup  
[PLEASE CREATE YOUR OWN COMPILABLE RUNNABLE FUNCTION in SEPERATE .c FILES]  
Think of it as bot(); is in its own .c file so you might have an empty main but you have ONLY your function there.  
Then do things to make it work  
Example: inside jun.c
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    ///Something
}

void bot(){
///your code
}
```
You won't need a dice function or anything extra.  
Just pretend your dice is like 5 so...  
int diceRoll = 5;  
As long as it works.

Code your won way with your own little individual variables first.
