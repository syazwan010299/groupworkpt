Yo, waddup

Use the struct to integrate everyone's work.
we have player[i].gamePiece //which player we changing values for
we have player[i].boardPos //which position on the board do we want to move the player to.


Want to move player X on the board?
You can change the position using player[0].boardPos

Just create you rown functions and pass the variable.

Eg: 

---main---

movePlayer(player[0].boardPos)


---function---

void movePlayer(int x)

{

//Do shit

}
